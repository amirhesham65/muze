## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to Muze, please start a discussion by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/urmilshroff/muze/issues/new/choose) first. It helps me understand your proposal and discuss wether it is necessary or not.

Alternatively, you can help by resolving any of the [open issues](https://github.com/urmilshroff/muze/issues) as well.
