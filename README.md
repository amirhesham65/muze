### About

Jam tunes with your friends! Muze can be thought of as a [Netflix Party](https://www.netflixparty.com/) for music. The idea is to create 'rooms' which your friends can join. Anyone can send music to the room and play/pause a track, which will then be play/paused for everyone in the room in realtime sync.

It is my personal project with the idea being inspired by social distancing norms during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. I can't listen to music with my friends anymore, and this app aims to solve that.

### Prototype

I've made a simple prototype of the app on Figma, which you can view [here](https://www.figma.com/file/son6xQvcS1tEbm1lRPS7Uh/Muze-Prototype?node-id=0%3A1). If you would like to improve it, please [contact me](https://urmilshroff.tech/)!

## Building

To build and run the app on your device, do the following:

-   [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/) by following the instructions on their website.
-   Fork/clone this repo to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/urmilshroff/muze.git`.
-   Connect your devices/emulators and run the app using `flutter run` in the root of the project directory.

### Implementation

The app is made using [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) with [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) for state management, and separation of UI & logic as much as possible in an effort to follow clean architecture practices. It's not perfect, but I'm still learning!

### Contributing

The frontend of the app is entirely open source, and I'd love if you could contribute to it! Please see the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
